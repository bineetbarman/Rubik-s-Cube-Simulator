# Rubik's Cube Simulator
A 3-dimensional Rubik's Cube Simulator based on isometric projection.

# Background
This project was made for "Computer Science (New)" course in class 12 under CBSE. Minimal adjustments have been made to it in the present version.

# Software requirements
Python Interpreter with tkinter module (inbuilt in the official Python Interpreter, IDLE)

# How to run
Create a folder.  
Put the given python file in it. Run the program.  
Use the on-screen buttons or keyboard to solve the cube.  
Using the "Save" option (in the program) will create a binary file in the current folder. Next time you run the program, it will show the last saved stage (or the default state if the file is corrupted).
